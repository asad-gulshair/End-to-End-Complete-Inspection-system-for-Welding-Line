Weld Defect Detection • Coating Defect Detection • Flange Dimension Compliance

Complete End-to-End AI Web Application (Frontend + Backend)

🚀 Overview

RICI AI Inspection System is a complete AI-powered inspection platform that automates:

🔧 1. Weld Defect Detection

YOLO-based defect identification

Bounding boxes + confidence

Supports images & videos

🎨 2. Coating Defect Detection

Identifies coating cracks, blisters, chips, corrosion

Works on high-resolution images

🔩 3. Flange Dimension Compliance System

Uses ArUco markers + depth / camera calibration

Measures critical flange parameters

Auto-checks compliance using standard flange datasets

Supports custom unit selection (mm / inches)

The project includes a complete backend, frontend dashboard, sample inputs/outputs, and a demo video — except trained model files.

Dataset and further deatials can be provided only for research purpose.
